A system on your network executed the command "adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=person)" > users.txt"

What do you look for to start investigating this event? 

Assume you have access to any evidence source you want o up the process execution chain. Was it an "automated" or manual execution?
Which directory was that AdFind executed from? 

Which user ran it? 

What did that user do on the system before running it?

Is AdFind commonly used on that system/network?
