A user workstation made a DNS query for a domain that was reported to be associated with malvertising activity.

What do you look for to start investigating this event?

Assume you have access to any evidence source you want.

Just to kick off the investigation - get time of the query, pull proxy logs +/- 15 minutes around this time to see why the user accessed the site
(SEO-poisoned Google search, phish mail, etc) and validate whether  or not the user actually visited the site after the DNS query
