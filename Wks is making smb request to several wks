Investigation Scenario ðŸ”Ž

A workstation attempted authentication to every other Windows system on the local network.

What do you look for to start investigating this event?

Assume you have access to any evidence source you want, but no commercial EDR tools.

#InvestigationPath

First and foremost, I would consult my CMDB record. Is it a normal user workstation or a specific workstation installed
with a legit tool that works by crawling and authenticating on all other workstation on the network.
Ask the product owner to check if the tool behaves that way

 Source and Destination IPs
- Which Process and Port is responsible 
- Which User
- Any connections from External to Source Computer
- Suspicious Port Connections 
- Which Commands executed in the past and after the event
- Which usernames where used on the destination machines
